              However, their transcriptional characterization is still
              incomplete. Here, we sequenced the transcriptomes of thousands of

              $\gamma$, $\epsilon$, and stellate cells, and revealed
              subpopulations of $\alpha$, $\beta$, and acinar cells.
              Intriguingly, $\delta$ cells expressed several important
              receptors, indicating an unrecognized importance of these cells
              in integrating paracrine and systemic metabolic signals. Genes
              previously associated with obesity or diabetes were found to
              correlate with BMI. Finally, comparing healthy and T2D

               previously developed an approach for digital cytometry, called

              quadratic programming for estimating the mixing proportions of
              distinctive tissue types in next-generation sequencing data. We
              demonstrated the feasibility and validity of DeconRNASeq across a
              range of mixing levels and sources using mRNA-Seq data mixed in
              silico at known concentrations. We validated our computational
              approach for various benchmark data, with high correlation
              between our predicted cell proportions and the real fractions of

              immune cells such as Kupffer cells. Liver immune responses are
              delicately tuned between tolerance to many antigens flowing in
              from the alimentary tract, a tolerance that likely makes the
              liver less prone to rejection than other solid organ transplants,
              and reaction to local injury, systemic inflammation, and
              regeneration. Notably, complement is a double-edged sword as
              activation is detrimental by inducing inflammatory tissue damage
              in, for example, ischemia-reperfusion injury and transplant
              rejection yet is beneficial for liver tissue regeneration.
              Therapeutic complement inhibition is rapidly developing for
              routine clinical treatment of several diseases. In the liver,
              targeted inhibition of damaged tissue may be a rational and
              promising approach to avoid further tissue destruction and
              simultaneously preserve beneficial effects of complement in areas
              of proliferation. Here, we argue that complement is a key system
              to manipulate in the liver in several clinical settings,
              including liver injury and regeneration after major surgery and
              preservation of the organ during transplantation.",

  abstract = "UNLABELLED: Major causes of lipid accumulation in liver are increased import or synthesis or decreased catabolism of fatty acids. The latter is caused by dysfunction of cellular organelles controlling energy homeostasis, i.e., mitochondria. Peroxisomes also appear to be an important organelle in lipid metabolism of
              hepatocytes, but little is known about their role in the
              development of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). To
              investigate the role of peroxisomes alongside mitochondria in
              excessive hepatic lipid accumulation, we used leptin-resistant
              db/db mice on C57BLKS background, a mouse model that develops
              hyperphagia-induced diabetes with obesity and NAFLD. Proteome and
              gene expression analyses along with lipid analyses in the liver
              revealed differential expression of genes related to lipid
              metabolism and $\beta$-oxidation, whereas genes for peroxisomal
              proteins were predominantly regulated. CONCLUSION: Our
              investigations show that in fatty liver disease in combination
              with obesity and diabetes, the hepatocyte-protecting organelle
              peroxisome is altered. Hence, peroxisomes might indicate a stage
              of pre-NAFLD, play a role in the early development of NAFLD and
              appear to be a potential target for treatment and prevention of

              reactions, where the initial lesion is followed by secondary
              inflammation and edema. Our laboratory and others have reported
              that angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) have efficacy in
              improving recovery from traumatic brain injury in mice. Treatment
              of mice with a subhypotensive dose of the ARB candesartan results
              in improved functional recovery, and reduced pathology (lesion
              volume, inflammation and gliosis). In order to gain a better
              understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which
              candesartan improves recovery after controlled cortical impact
              injury (CCI), we performed transcriptomic profiling on brain
              regions after injury and drug treatment. We examined RNA
              expression in the ipsilateral hippocampus, thalamus and
              hypothalamus at 3 or 29 days post injury (dpi) treated with
              either candesartan (0.1 mg/kg) or vehicle. RNA was isolated and
              analyzed by bulk mRNA-seq. Gene expression in injured and/or
              candesartan treated brain region was compared to that in sham
              vehicle treated mice in the same brain region to identify genes
              that were differentially expressed (DEGs) between groups. The
              most DEGs were expressed in the hippocampus at 3 dpi, and the
              number of DEGs reduced with distance and time from the lesion.
              Among pathways that were differentially expressed at 3 dpi after
              CCI, candesartan treatment altered genes involved in
              angiogenesis, interferon signaling, extracellular matrix
              regulation including integrins and chromosome maintenance and DNA
              replication. At 29 dpi, candesartan treatment reduced the
              expression of genes involved in the inflammatory response. Some
              changes in gene expression were confirmed in a separate cohort of
              animals by qPCR. Fewer DEGs were found in the thalamus, and only
              one in the hypothalamus at 3 dpi. Additionally, in the hippocampi
              of sham injured mice, 3 days of candesartan treatment led to the
              differential expression of 384 genes showing that candesartan in
              the absence of injury had a powerful impact on gene expression
              specifically in the hippocampus. Our results suggest that
              candesartan has broad actions in the brain after injury and
              affects different processes at acute and chronic times after
              injury. These data should assist in elucidating the beneficial
              effect of candesartan on recovery from TBI.",

               regions and behaviors in a sex-linked manner. Placental hormone
               replacement might offer novel therapeutic opportunities to
               prevent later neurobehavioral disorders. Placental dysfunction
               has been implicated in abnormal neurodevelopment. Vacher et al.
               found that loss of a neuroactive hormone from the placenta
               alters brain development in a regional and sex-linked manner,
               resulting in autism-like behaviors in male offspring.",

  abstract = "Cell fate acquisition is a fundamental developmental process in
              all multicellular organisms. Yet, much is unknown regarding how a
              cell traverses the pathway from stem cell to terminal
              differentiation. Advances in single cell genomics[1][1] hold
              promise for unraveling developmental mechanisms[2][2]--[3][3] in
              tissues[4][4], organs[5][5]--[6][6], and organisms[7][7]--[8][8].
              However, lineage tracing can be challenging for some
              tissues[9][9] and integration of high-quality datasets is often
              necessary to detect rare cell populations and developmental
              states[10][10],[11][11]. Here, we harmonized single cell mRNA
              sequencing data from over 110,000 cells to construct a
              comprehensive atlas for a stereotypically developing organ with
              indeterminate growth, the Arabidopsis root. To test the utility
              of the atlas to interpret new datasets, we profiled mutants for
              two key transcriptional regulators at single cell resolution,
              shortroot and scarecrow . Although both transcription factors are
              required for early specification of cell identity[12][12], our
              results suggest the existence of an alternative pathway acting in
              mature cells to specify endodermal identity, for which SHORTROOT
              is required. Uncovering the architecture of this pathway will
              provide insight into specification and stabilization of the
              endodermis, a tissue analogous to the mammalian epithelium. Thus,
              the atlas is a pivotal advance for unraveling the transcriptional
              programs that specify and maintain cell identity to regulate
              organ development in space and time. \#\#\# Competing Interest

              noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) contribute to the specialized functions
              of cells within an organ is poorly understood. We generated a
              comprehensive dataset of gene expression from individual cell
              types of the Arabidopsis root. Comparisons across cell types
              revealed that alternative splicing tends to remove parts of
              coding regions from a longer, major isoform, providing evidence
              for a progressive mechanism of splicing. Cell-type-specific
              intron retention suggested a possible origin for this common form
              of alternative splicing. Coordinated alternative splicing across
              developmental stages pointed to a role in regulating
              differentiation. Consistent with this hypothesis, distinct
              isoforms of a transcription factor were shown to control
              developmental transitions. lincRNAs were generally lowly

              carried out to uncover the features that are essential for
              germination and early seedling growth under anoxic conditions.
              Temporal analysis of the transcriptome and methylome from
              germination to young seedlings under aerobic and anaerobic
              conditions revealed 82\% similarity in the transcriptome and no
              differences in the epigenome up to 24 h. Following germination,
              significant changes in the transcriptome and DNA methylation were
              observed between 4-day aerobically and anaerobically grown
              coleoptiles. A link between the epigenomic state and cell
              division versus cell elongation is suggested, as no differences
              in DNA methylation were observed between 24-h aerobically and
              anaerobically germinating embryos, when there is little cell
              division. After that, epigenetic changes appear to correlate with
              differences between cell elongation (anaerobic conditions) versus
              cell division (aerobic conditions) in the coleoptiles.
              Re-oxygenation of 3-day anaerobically grown seedlings resulted in
              rapid transcriptomic changes in DNA methylation in these
              coleoptiles. Unlike the transcriptome, changes in DNA methylation
              upon re-oxygenation did not reflect those seen in aerobic
              coleoptiles, but instead, reverted to a pattern similar to dry
              seeds. Reversion to the ?dry seed? state of DNA methylation upon
              re-oxygenation may act to ?reset the clock? for the rapid
              molecular changes and cell division that result upon
              re-oxygenation.",

              languages, such as R. Here I present gganatogram, an R package
              used to plot modular species anatograms based on a combination of
              the graphical grammar of ggplot2 and the publicly available
              anatograms from the Expression Atlas. This combination allows for
              quick and easy, modular, and reproducible generation of
              anatograms. Using only one command and a data frame with tissue
              name, group, colour, and value, this tool enables the user to
              visualise specific human and mouse tissues with desired colours,
              grouped by a variable, or displaying a desired value, such as
              gene-expression, pharmacokinetics, or bacterial load across
              selected tissues. gganatogram consists of 5 highly annotated
              organisms, male/female human/mouse, and a cell anatogram. It
              further consists of 24 other less annotated organisms from the
              animal and plant kingdom. I hope that this tool will be useful by
              the wider community in biological sciences. Community members are
              welcome to submit additional anatograms, which can be
              incorporated into the package. A stable version gganatogram has
              been deposited to neuroconductor, and a development version can
              be found on github/jespermaag/gganatogram. An interactive shiny
              app of gganatogram can be found on
              https://jespermaag.shinyapps.io/gganatogram/, which allows for
              non-R users to create anatograms.",

              a visual analytic tool for exploring multiple levels of
              Arabidopsis thaliana data through a zoomable user interface.
              ePlant connects to several publicly available web services to

              molecular structure data for one or more genes or gene products

              other high-throughput projects for hypothesis generation has
              become a vital aspect of post-genomic research. For the
              non-bioinformatics specialist, however, many of the currently
              available tools provide overwhelming amounts of data that are
              presented in a non-intuitive way. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS:
              In order to facilitate the interpretation and analysis of
              microarray data and data from other large-scale data sets, we
              have developed a tool, which we have dubbed the electronic
              Fluorescent Pictograph - or eFP - Browser, available at
              http://www.bar.utoronto.ca/, for exploring microarray and other
              data for hypothesis generation. This eFP Browser engine paints
              data from large-scale data sets onto pictographic representations
              of the experimental samples used to generate the data sets. We
              give examples of using the tool to present Arabidopsis gene

              large-scale data sets from any organism and thus should prove

              used for finding clusters (modules) of highly correlated genes,
              for summarizing such clusters using the module eigengene or an
              intramodular hub gene, for relating modules to one another and to
              external sample traits (using eigengene network methodology), and
              for calculating module membership measures. Correlation networks
              facilitate network based gene screening methods that can be used
              to identify candidate biomarkers or therapeutic targets. These
              methods have been successfully applied in various biological
              contexts, e.g. cancer, mouse genetics, yeast genetics, and
              analysis of brain imaging data. While parts of the correlation
              network methodology have been described in separate publications,
              there is a need to provide a user-friendly, comprehensive, and
              consistent software implementation and an accompanying tutorial.
              RESULTS: The WGCNA R software package is a comprehensive
              collection of R functions for performing various aspects of
              weighted correlation network analysis. The package includes
              functions for network construction, module detection, gene
              selection, calculations of topological properties, data
              simulation, visualization, and interfacing with external
              software. Along with the R package we also present R software
              tutorials. While the methods development was motivated by gene
              expression data, the underlying data mining approach can be
              applied to a variety of different settings. CONCLUSION: The WGCNA
              package provides R functions for weighted correlation network
              analysis, e.g. co-expression network analysis of gene expression
              data. The R package along with its source code and additional
              material are freely available at
